When I was young I used to play football in my apartment.
My sister coul not go to sleep unless her room had a light on.
I used to sleep in mu sister's room when I was scare.
When my friends came to my apartment I used to throw my toys outside the window.
Both mom and dad work until pretty late.
On the weekends we used to go to the club and play tenis.
Once my sister try to wash both feet at once in the washbasin. She felt and broke her head.
